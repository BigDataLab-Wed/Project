Bank Customer Churn Prediction

In this project, we want to prevent bank customer churn.

These days, one of the significant problems of bank systems which they tackle with, is missing their customers day by day. In order to solve this issue, banks need to attract more customers than retaining ones, and try to preserve their previous customers as well. As banks datasets considered as a Big dataset, in this project we want to have a prediction on customer churn.

We aim to accomplish the following for this study:

  1.Recognizing which factors will effect on customer churn
  2.Predicting a model for:
      •	Classifying if a customer will churn or not 
      •	Based on customer performance, effort to prevent their churn
